# INTRO

A little intro to PHP.

Apparently, I need a webserver with PHP and MySQL.
- This [site](https://www.atlantic.net/vps-hosting/how-to-deploy-a-php-application-with-nginx-and-mysql-using-docker-and-docker-compose/) seems to have a pretty nice tutorial.
1. Install Docker and Docker Composel(https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)
2. Follow instructions of abovementioned tutorial.
